This article about the Cocoa Text System was written in 2006 and hasn’t been much updated since. Its primary web home is [here](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/cocoa-text.html)

I’m putting it here in case someone wants to download the whole shebang in an easier way than traversing the links on the original page.
